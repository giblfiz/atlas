## The Ethereum Atlas Project

Property ownership records and fraud are a worldwide problem, and one which blockchain technologies are especially suited to address. The Ethereum Atlas system aims to handle these problems by making real estate ownership records universally accessible and decentralized, while also preserving anonymity where necessary. Ethereum Atlas allows for simple and easy verification of ownership by anyone with access to an internet connection, a powerful tool in preventing fraud.

The Ethereum Atlas system uses physical paper documents as a basic store of ownership, and is intentionally designed to require the attention of a Notary in order to facilitate the legal transfer of real estate. In addition, administrative tools allow government officials to correct errors, provide judicial corrections, and recover access to property in cases where an owner has lost her documentation or keys. In order to produce a system robust against fraud, abuse, and centralization of power, administrative actions require multiple different types of accounts to sign their actions.

In all cases, and for all actions, an indelible and auditable record is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for careful review when desired, as well as greater transparency and integrity.

Ethereum Atlas is a fully functional proof of concept that was produced from start to finish between Dec 15, 2016 and Jan 8, 2017 for the UAE Blockchain Virtual GovHack (blockchainvirtualgovhack.com). It is built on the Ethereum blockchain in Solidity and uses ReactJS, Redux, Webpack, Web3, and the Google Maps API for its core functionality.
