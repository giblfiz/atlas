## Two ways to use Atlas:
1) Visit the live demo at <a href=http://34.192.3.172>34.192.3.172</a> (soon ethereumatlas.online once DNS propagates).

  * This is connected to public geth node and should work in any modern browser.

  * You can click Transfer link or Create at the upper right of the live app to interact with the land parcel management system.

  * NOTE: The QR code scanning feature will not work for the moment due to HTTPS requirements.
  * NOTE: Because of geth security features, we are unable to keep the accounts on this node unlocked
  in order to allow users to transfer and create parcels.

2) Run locally on your machine. Simply clone the 'client_public' repo and launch via Node (`npm start`).
  
  * NOTE: Your private accounts will NOT be 'officer' types, so it will be impossible to complete any transactions this way.

## How to transfer a parcel:
For any parcel transfer to complete it needs EITHER:
A) The transfer to be completed by a Notary and by any account with the secret key for the parcel.
B) The transfer to be completed by a Notary account, a Federal account, and a Judicial account.
